# arduino
This repository contains source code for various Arduino projects that I have
been working on. Please see the readme file in each individual project for more
information.

In order to compile the C++ source you will need to include and link against
the Arduino libraries. Compiling this code through the Arduino IDE or Web IDE
and uploading the binaries to your own Arduino should be straight forward.
