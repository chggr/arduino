# SpectrumAnalyzer

In this project we are building a device that can be used to visualize the
sound waves that are produced by a sound source before they reach our ears.
The device intercepts the sound signal travelling from a sound source (radio,
mp3 player, PC) to our speakers or headphones, analyzes it and displays its
spectrum or wave plot in an OLED screen.



### Hardware

The hardware for this project consists of the following components: an Arduino
Nano, a small 128x64 SSD1306 OLED screen, an LM358P dual Operational Amplifier
chip, four 10 KOhm variable resistors, two 1 uF electrolytic capacitors, two
3\.5 mm stereo jack connectors and a button.
